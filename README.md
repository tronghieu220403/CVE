# Introduction
This is my report of CVEs while I was in Viettel Cyber Security as an Software Exploitation Intern.

## Detail:
This repo include 3 CVEs:
- CVE-2015-1701: A Win32k LPE vulnerability used in APT attack.
- CVE-2017-5375: JIT code allocation can allow for a bypass of ASLR and DEP protections leading to potential memory corruption attacks.
- CVE-2022-28672: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader 11.2.1.53537

## Note:
The three reports in this package are written in Vietnamese using Microsoft Word and presented sloppily. They were written when I still lacked knowledge of how to present and use tools and applications to create an easy-to-read report. I apologize for this inconvenience.
